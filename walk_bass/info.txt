A simple program that will create walking bass lines where the notes selected will correlate to binary digits the user chose
Not the most optimal notes chosen for walking (choses closest note in scale, not closes note to the note you have to get to), but oh well

To do:
Add a decryption program
Allow the user to enter more than two chords to walk on
All the user to do more than two binary digits at a time
