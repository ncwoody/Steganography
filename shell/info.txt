A simple shell that I made that will run the programs that I put into this repository.

This may well not be the most optimal way to implement the features that I want to implement, I will work on updating to the best solutions as I have the time.

To Do:
Make sizeof() function work correctly
Maybe have the edit function compile and run the shell again itself
