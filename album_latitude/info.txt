This file is a program which will take a set of latitude and longitude coordinates and turn them into a list of favorite songs and albums.
This project was started in January of 2020 by Noah Woodman.
While this project is in a semi-working state, it is not completely finished, and I will hopefully continue work on it when I have time.

To do:
Fix randomness (currently was just made to work, but is predictable)
Fix decryption (has some warnings when compiling)
Fix selection overall (currently has some bugs, such as being able to pick the same song twice, and not utilizing all songs which are referenced in the program)
